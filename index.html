      <h2>ðŸ“œ About the sixth planet</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun located in the Solar System. It is the second largest planet in the
        Solar System, after Jupiter. Saturn is one of the four gas giant planets, along with Jupiter, Uranus, and
        Neptune.
      </p>

      <p>
        Saturn is the English transliteration from the Latin word Saturnus, in Roman religion, the god of sowing or
        seed. The Romans equated him with the Greek agricultural deity Kronos. Saturn was named after the Roman god
        Saturnus (called Kronos in Greek mythology). Saturn's symbol is â™„ which is the symbol of Saturnus' sickle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside Saturn is probably a core of iron, nickel, silicon and oxygen compounds, surrounded by a deep layer of
        metallic hydrogen, then a layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and finally, an outer gaseous layer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Saturn has 82 known moons orbiting the planet. 53 are officially named and 29 are waiting to be named. The
        largest moon is Titan, which is larger in volume than the planet Mercury. Titan is the second-largest moon in
        the Solar System. The largest moon is Jupiter's moon, Ganymede. There is also a very large system of rings
        around Saturn. These rings are made of ice with smaller amounts of rocks and dust. Some people believe that the
        rings were caused by a moon impact or other event. Saturn is about 1,433,000,000 km (870,000,000 mi) on average
        from the Sun. Saturn takes 29.6 Earth years to revolve around the Sun.

      <h2>Physical features</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Saturn is an oblate spheroid, meaning that it is flattened at the poles, and it swells out around its
        equator. The planet's equatorial diameter is 120,536 km (74,898 mi), while its polar diameter (the distance
        from the north pole to the south pole) is 108,728 km (67,560 mi); a 9% difference. Saturn has a flattened
        shape due to its very fast rotation, once every 10.8 hours.
        Saturn is the only planet in the Solar System that is less dense than water. Even though the planet's core is
        very dense, it has a gaseous atmosphere, so the average specific density of the planet is 0.69 g/cm3. This means
        if Saturn could be placed in a large pool of water, it would float.
      </p>

      <h3>Storms and spots</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Saturn's atmosphere is also known to form oval shaped clouds, similar to the clearer spots seen in Jupiter.
        These oval spots are cyclonic storms, the same as cyclones seen on Earth. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope
        found a very large white cloud near Saturn's equator. Storms like the one in 1990 were known as Great White
        Spots. These unique storms only exist for a short time and only happen about every 30 Earth years, at the time
        of the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. Great White Spots were also found in 1876, 1903, 1933,
        and 1960. If this cycle continues, another storm will form in about 2020.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Voyager 1 spacecraft found a hexagonal cloud pattern near Saturn's north pole at about 78Â°N. The
        Cassiniâˆ’Huygens probe later confirmed it in 2006. Unlike the north pole, the south pole does not show any
        hexagonal cloud feature. The probe also discovered a hurricane-like storm locked to the south pole that clearly
        showed an eyewall. Until this discovery, eyewalls had only been seen on Earth.
      </p>

      <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
      <hr>

      <p>
        The outer part of Saturn's atmosphere is made up of about 96% hydrogen, 3% helium, 0.4% methane and 0.01%
        ammonia. There are also very small amounts of acetylene, ethane and phosphine.
        The hexagonal cloud
        The north polar hexagonal cloud first found by Voyager 1 and later by Cassini
        Saturn's clouds show a banded pattern, like the cloud bands seen on Jupiter. Saturn's clouds are much fainter
        and the bands are wider at the equator. Saturn's lowest cloud layer is made up of water ice, and is about 10 km
        (6 mi) thick. The temperature here is quite low, at 250 K (-10Â°F, -23Â°C). However scientists do not agree
        about this. The layer above, about 77 km (48 mi) thick, is made up of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, and above that
        is a layer of ammonia ice clouds 80 km (50 mi) thick. The highest layer is made up of hydrogen and helium
        gases, which extends between 200 km (124 mi) and 270 km (168 mi) above the water cloud tops. Auroras are also
        known to form in Saturn in the mesosphere. The temperature at Saturn's cloud tops is extremely low, at 98 K
        (-283 Â°F, -175 Â°C). The temperatures in the inner layers are much higher than the outside layers because of the
        heat produced by Saturn's interior. Saturn's winds are some of the fastest in the Solar System, reaching
        1,800 km/h (1,118 mph), ten times faster than winds on Earth.
      </p>

      <h3>Interior</h3>
      <hr>

      <p>
        Saturn's interior is similar to Jupiter's interior. It has a small rocky core about the size of the Earth at its
        center. It is very hot; its temperature reaches 15,000 K (26,540 Â°F (14,727 Â°C)). Saturn is so hot that it
        gives out more heat energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Above it is a thicker layer of metallic
        hydrogen, about 30,000 km (18,641 mi) deep. Above that layer is a region of liquid hydrogen and helium. The core
        is heavy, with about 9 to 22 times more mass than the Earth's core.
      </p>

      <h3>Magnetic Field</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Saturn has a natural magnetic field that is weaker than Jupiter's. Like the Earth's, Saturn's field is a
        magnetic dipole. Saturn's field is unique in that it is perfectly symmetrical, unlike any other known
        planet. This means the field is exactly in line with the planet's axis. Saturn generates radio waves,
        but they are too weak to be detected from Earth. The moon Titan orbits in the outer part of Saturn's
        magnetic field and gives out plasma to the field from the ionised particles in Titan's atmosphere.

      <h3>Spokes</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The Voyager space probe discovered features shaped like rays, called spokes. These were also seen later by
        the Hubble telescope. The Cassini probe photographed the spokes in 2005. They are seen as dark when under
        sunlight, and appear light when against the unlit side. At first it was thought the spokes were made of
        microscopic dust particles but new evidence shows that they are made of ice. They rotate at the same time
        with the planet's magnetosphere, therefore, it is believed that they have a connection with electromagnetism.
        However, what causes the spokes to form is still unknown. They appear to be seasonal, disappearing during
        solstice and appearing again during equinox.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The rings were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610, using his telescope. They did not look like rings to
        Galileo, so he called them "handles". He thought that Saturn was three separate planets that almost touched one
        another. In 1612, when the rings were facing edge on with the Earth, the rings disappeared, then reappeared
        again in 1613, further confusing Galileo. In 1655, Christiaan Huygens was the first person to recognise
        Saturn was surrounded by rings. Using a much more powerful telescope than Galilei's, he noted Saturn "is
        surrounded by a thin, flat, ring, nowhere touching...". In 1675, Giovanni Domenico Cassini discovered that
        the planet's rings were in fact made of smaller ringlets with gaps. The largest ring gap was later named the
        Cassini Division. In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell showed that the rings cannot be solid, but are made of small
        particles, each orbiting Saturn on their own, otherwise, it would become unstable or break apart. James
        Keeler studied the rings using a spectroscope in 1895 which proved Maxwell's theory.

      <h3>Exploration</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Saturn was first explored by the Pioneer 11 spacecraft in September 1979. It flew as close as 20,000 km (12,427
        mi) above the planet's cloud tops. It took photographs of the planet and a few of its moons, but were low in
        resolution. It discovered a new, thin ring called the F ring. It also discovered that the dark ring gaps appear
        bright when viewed towards the Sun, which shows the gaps are not empty of material. The spacecraft measured the
        temperature of the moon Titan.
      </p>

      <p>
        In November 1980, Voyager 1 visited Saturn and took higher resolution photographs of the planet, rings, and
        moons. These photos were able to show the surface features of the moons. Voyager 1 went close to Titan and
        gained much information about its atmosphere. In August 1981, Voyager 2 continued to study the planet. Photos
        taken by the space probe showed that changes were happening to the rings and atmosphere. The Voyager spacecraft
        discovered a number of moons orbiting close to Saturn's rings, as well as discovering new ring gaps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Drawing of Cassini in orbit around Saturn
        On July 1, 2004, the Cassiniâˆ’Huygens probe entered into orbit around Saturn. Before then, it flew close to
        Phoebe, taking very high-resolution photos of its surface and collecting data. On December 25, 2004, the Huygens
        probe separated from the Cassini probe before moving down towards Titan's surface and landed there on January
        14, 2005. It landed on a dry surface, but it found that large bodies of liquid exist on the moon. The Cassini
        probe continued to collect data from Titan and a number of the icy moons. It found evidence that the moon
        Enceladus had water erupting from its geysers. Cassini also proved, in July 2006, that Titan had hydrocarbon
        lakes, located near its north pole. In March 2007, it discovered a large hydrocarbon lake the size of the
        Caspian Sea near its north pole.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cassini observed lightning occurring in Saturn since early 2005. The power of the lightning was measured to be
        1,000 times more powerful than lightning on Earth. Astronomers believe that the lightning observed in Saturn is
        the strongest ever seen.

      <h3>The 62 Moons</h3>
      <p>
        Saturn has 53 named moons, and another 29 which are still being studied. Many of the moons are very small:
        33 are less than 10 km (6 mi) in diameter and 13 moons are less than 50 km (31 mi). Seven moons are large
        enough to be a near perfect sphere caused by their own gravitation. These moons are Titan, Rhea, Iapetus, Dione,
        Tethys, Enceladus and Mimas. Titan is the largest moon, larger than the planet Mercury, and it is the only
        moon in the Solar System to have a thick, dense atmosphere. Hyperion and Phoebe are the next largest
        moons, larger than 200 km (124 mi) in diameter.

      <h3>Mimas Moon</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Mimas is one of Saturn's largest moons. It is also called Saturn I. Mimas is best known
        for its large crater, Herschel. In the centre of the crater is a very high mountain. Mimas was discovered by the
        English astronomer William Herschel on September 17, 1789. The moon is believed to have created the Cassini
        Division. This is a 4,800 km gap between Saturn's A and B rings.
